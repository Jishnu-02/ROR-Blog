Processing by PostsController#create as TURBO_STREAM
  Parameters: {"authenticity_token"=>"[FILTERED]", "post"=>{"title"=>"Top 5 Most Successful Clubs in Europe", "author"=>"", "text"=>"A list of the most successful football clubs in Europe\n\nWhen you think about the most successful club in Europe, who comes to mind? Manchester United, Real Madrid and Barcelona probably spring straight to mind. Only two of these clubs make the list, and they still don’t break into the top two.\n\nThe amount of trophies a club has doesn’t make them better another, but being the most successful club in Europe is a bragging right on its own.\n\nIn this post, we’ve looked at which club in Europe’s top divisions has the most trophies locked up in their museum.\n\n5. SL Benfica (83 trophies)\nThe most successful team in Portugal, SL Benfica sit proudly in fifth place as one of the most successful teams in Europe. \n\nBenfica have a record amount of Primeira Liga titles (37), a record amount of Taca de Portugal titles (26), a record amount of Taca da Liga titles (7), 8 Supertaca Candido de Oliveira, 3 Campeonato de Portugal and 2 European Cups.\n\nGolden years\nIn the 1960s, Benfica went through its golden years by winning back-to-back European Cups in ‘61 and ‘62. Throughout the ‘60s Benfica reached three more European Cup finals, losing all three.\n\nIt was during these years that legendary Portuguese striker, Eusebio, played for Benfica scoring a remarkable 317 goals in 301 games. Eusebio is still the only player to win a Ballon d’Or while playing for a Portuguese club.\n\nAs well as glory in the European Cup, the 1960s saw Benfica win eight Premeria Liga titles and three Taca de Portugal cups.\n\nIn the ‘70s, Benfica continued to strive domestically, winning six Primeira Liga titles and two Taca de Portugal titles. In Europe, Benfica only managed to reach the semi-finals, beaten by Ajax and Johan Cruyff.\n\nBack from the brink\nAfter financial troubles in the ‘80s due to poor financial management, things didn’t get any easier for Benfica in the ‘90s. After decades of success, Benfica struggled domestically and in Europe- and entered a rare trophy.\n\nIt wasn’t until the 2003-04 season that Benfica would win their first trophy since the 1995-96 season. The season after this, Benfica won their first league title since 1994. More success would begin to follow from 2003-04, as Benfica looked to regain its dominance in Portgual.\n\n4. Barcelona (87 trophies)\nCompeting with Spanish rivals Real Madrid, Barcelona is a dominant force in Spain and they have enjoyed spells of dominance in European competitions.\n\nBarca has 26 La Liga titles, a record 31 Copa del Ray titles, a record 12 Supercopa de Espana titles, five European Cups/UEFA Champion Leagues, a record four UEFA Cup Winners’ Cups, a record five UEFA Super Cups and three FIFA Club World Cups.\n\nJohan Cruyff and Diego Maradona\nCruyff arrived from Ajax for a then-record fee of £920,000. In his first season, Cruyff helped Barca win their first league title for 14 years. The win included an impressive 5-0 victory away at Real Madrid.\n\nAfter Cruyff departed, Barca looked to replace their star man with another star name. In 1982, they did just that by signing Maradona for a world record fee of £5 million. His time at Barca was short, but Maradona picked up a Copa del Ray and Spanish Super Cup medal.\n\nruyff returned as manager in 1988, leading to a spell of dominance for the Spanish giants. \n\nPlayers such as Hristo Stoichkov, Pep Guardiola, Eusebio, Ronald Koeman and Michael Laudrup were all part of Cruyff’s dream team era.\n\nCruyff saw Barca win 11 trophies under his management, including four consecutive La Liga titles.\n\nLionel Messi, Xavi and Iniesta\nFormer player Guardiola took over as manager in 2008 and brought with him his tika-taka style that would change the game completely.\n\nPep inherited a team full of stars such as Ronaldinho, Messi, Iniesta, Xavi and Carlos Puyol. Pep was quick to put his stamp on the team. Out went Ronaldinho and Deco, as Pep shaped his team around Messi, Xavi and Iniesta.\n\nDuring Pep’s spell, they became the dominant team in Europe. During his four year spell at the club, Barca won 14 trophies including, two UEFA Champions Leagues and two FIFA Club World Cups.\n\nRecent years\nBarcelona has recently faced financial struggles which led to Messi reluctantly leaving the club after 21 years. On the field, Barca dropped into the Europa League for the first time in 17 years.\n\nThe former midfielder, Xavi, recently became the Barca manager in the hope to return.\n\n3. Real Madrid (90 trophies)\nArguably one of the biggest clubs in world football, it is no surprise to see Real Madrid on this list.\n\nTheir trophy cabinet includes a record 35 La Liga’s, 19 Copa del Rey’s, 11 Supercopa de Espana’s, a record 13 European Cup/UEFA Champion Leagues, two UEFA Cup titles, four UEFA Super Cup titles, three Intercontinental Cups and four FIFA Club World Cups.\n\nEarly European success \nAfter the creation of the European Cup (known now as the UEFA Champions League), Madrid cemented itself as the dominant force in European football.\n\nThey won five European Cups in a row between 1956 and 1960, leading to Madrid being awarded the original cup and the right to wear the UEFA badge of honour.\n\nGalacticos\nMadrid is known for having a team full of star names who have worn the famous white strip. The likes of Alfredo Di Stefano, Hugo Sanchez and Emilio Butragueno have all been blessed to play for Madrid but under new president Florentino Perez, Madrid entered another level.\n\nPerez oversaw the signing of Luis Figo, Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo and David Beckham, to name a few. The influx of players saw immediate success with a UEFA Champions League and Intercontinental Cup success in 2002, followed by a La Liga title in 2003.\n\nDespite the immense talent in their squad, Madrid would go the next three seasons without winning a major title.\n\nCR7 and La Decima\nIn 2009, Real Madrid broke the transfer record when they signed Cristiano Ronaldo for £80 million from Manchester United. Ronaldo helped Madrid reach a record 32nd La Liga title.\n\nReal Madrid, aided by a front three of Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale, finally reached La Decima in 2014. Their 10th Champions League trophy was made even sweeter by beating their local rivals Atletico Madrid in the final.\n\nAfter finally reaching ten Champions League trophies, Madrid went on to win three Champions League in a row between 2014-2018. The 13 titles Madrid hold is the record for most Champions League titles.\n\n2.

Manchester United, Real Madrid and Barcelona probably spring straight to mind. Only two of these clubs make the list, and they still don’t break into the top two.\n\nThe amount of trophies a club has doesn’t make them better another, but being the most successful club in Europe is a bragging right on its own.\n\nIn this post, we’ve looked at which club in Europe’s top divisions has the most trophies locked up in their museum.\n\n5. SL Benfica (83 trophies)\nThe most successful team in Portugal, SL Benfica sit proudly in fifth place as one of the most successful teams in Europe. \n\nBenfica have a record amount of Primeira Liga titles (37), a record amount of Taca de Portugal titles (26), a record amount of Taca da Liga titles (7), 8 Supertaca Candido de Oliveira, 3 Campeonato de Portugal and 2 European Cups.\n\nGolden years\nIn the 1960s, Benfica went through its golden years by winning back-to-back European Cups in ‘61 and ‘62. Throughout the ‘60s Benfica reached three more European Cup finals, losing all three.\n\nIt was during these years that legendary Portuguese striker, Eusebio, played for Benfica scoring a remarkable 317 goals in 301 games. Eusebio is still the only player to win a Ballon d’Or while playing for a Portuguese club.\n\nAs well as glory in the European Cup, the 1960s saw Benfica win eight Premeria Liga titles and three Taca de Portugal cups.\n\nIn the ‘70s, Benfica continued to strive domestically, winning six Primeira Liga titles and two Taca de Portugal titles. In Europe, Benfica only managed to reach the semi-finals, beaten by Ajax and Johan Cruyff.\n\nBack from the brink\nAfter financial troubles in the ‘80s due to poor financial management, things didn’t get any easier for Benfica in the ‘90s. After decades of success, Benfica struggled domestically and in Europe- and entered a rare trophy.\n\nIt wasn’t until the 2003-04 season that Benfica would win their first trophy since the 1995-96 season. The season after this, Benfica won their first league title since 1994. More success would begin to follow from 2003-04, as Benfica looked to regain its dominance in Portgual.\n\n4. Barcelona (87 trophies)\nCompeting with Spanish rivals Real Madrid, Barcelona is a dominant force in Spain and they have enjoyed spells of dominance in European competitions.\n\nBarca has 26 La Liga titles, a record 31 Copa del Ray titles, a record 12 Supercopa de Espana titles, five European Cups/UEFA Champion Leagues, a record four UEFA Cup Winners’ Cups, a record five UEFA Super Cups and three FIFA Club World Cups.\n\nJohan Cruyff and Diego Maradona\nCruyff arrived from Ajax for a then-record fee of £920,000. In his first season, Cruyff helped Barca win their first league title for 14 years. The win included an impressive 5-0 victory away at Real Madrid.\n\nAfter Cruyff departed, Barca looked to replace their star man with another star name. In 1982, they did just that by signing Maradona for a world record fee of £5 million. His time at Barca was short, but Maradona picked up a Copa del Ray and Spanish Super Cup medal.\n\nruyff returned as manager in 1988, leading to a spell of dominance for the Spanish giants. \n\nPlayers such as Hristo Stoichkov, Pep Guardiola, Eusebio, Ronald Koeman and Michael Laudrup were all part of Cruyff’s dream team era.\n\nCruyff saw Barca win 11 trophies under his management, including four consecutive La Liga titles.\n\nLionel Messi, Xavi and Iniesta\nFormer player Guardiola took over as manager in 2008 and brought with him his tika-taka style that would change the game completely.\n\nPep inherited a team full of stars such as Ronaldinho, Messi, Iniesta, Xavi and Carlos Puyol. Pep was quick to put his stamp on the team. Out went Ronaldinho and Deco, as Pep shaped his team around Messi, Xavi and Iniesta.\n\nDuring Pep’s spell, they became the dominant team in Europe. During his four year spell at the club, Barca won 14 trophies including, two UEFA Champions Leagues and two FIFA Club World Cups.\n\nRecent years\nBarcelona has recently faced financial struggles which led to Messi reluctantly leaving the club after 21 years. On the field, Barca dropped into the Europa League for the first time in 17 years.\n\nThe former midfielder, Xavi, recently became the Barca manager in the hope to return.\n\n3. Real Madrid (90 trophies)\nArguably one of the biggest clubs in world football, it is no surprise to see Real Madrid on this list.\n\nTheir trophy cabinet includes a record 35 La Liga’s, 19 Copa del Rey’s, 11 Supercopa de Espana’s, a record 13 European Cup/UEFA Champion Leagues, two UEFA Cup titles, four UEFA Super Cup titles, three Intercontinental Cups and four FIFA Club World Cups.\n\nEarly European success \nAfter the creation of the European Cup (known now as the UEFA Champions League), Madrid cemented itself as the dominant force in European football.\n\nThey won five European Cups in a row between 1956 and 1960, leading to Madrid being awarded the original cup and the right to wear the UEFA badge of honour.\n\nGalacticos\nMadrid is known for having a team full of star names who have worn the famous white strip. The likes of Alfredo Di Stefano, Hugo Sanchez and Emilio Butragueno have all been blessed to play for Madrid but under new president Florentino Perez, Madrid entered another level.\n\nPerez oversaw the signing of Luis Figo, Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo and David Beckham, to name a few. The influx of players saw immediate success with a UEFA Champions League and Intercontinental Cup success in 2002, followed by a La Liga title in 2003.\n\nDespite the immense talent in their squad, Madrid would go the next three seasons without winning a major title.\n\nCR7 and La Decima\nIn 2009, Real Madrid broke the transfer record when they signed Cristiano Ronaldo for £80 million from Manchester United. Ronaldo helped Madrid reach a record 32nd La Liga title.\n\nReal Madrid, aided by a front three of Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale, finally reached La Decima in 2014. Their 10th Champions League trophy was made even sweeter by beating their local rivals Atletico Madrid in the final.\n\nAfter finally reaching ten Champions League trophies, Madrid went on to win three Champions League in a row between 2014-2018. The 13 titles Madrid hold is the record for most Champions League titles.\n\n2. Celtic (112 trophies)\nOne half of Glasgow and one half of the dominance in Scottish football, Celtic have found winning trophies in Scotland easy- and they also have past success in Europe under their belt.\n\nCeltic boast 51 SPL titles, 40 Scottish Cup titles, 20 Scottish League Cup titles and one European Cup.\n\nOne night in Lisbon \nCeltic had enjoyed years of domestic success, and in 1967, Celtic enjoyed success on the Continent. \n\nJock Stein led Celtic to glory in every competition they entered, but the most remarkable of these trophies was in Europe.

The story takes place in the imaginary land of Meluha and narrates how the inhabitants of that land are saved from their wars by a nomad named Shiva. It begins from where its predecessor, The Immortals of Meluha, left off, with Shiva trying to save Sati from the invading Naga. Later Shiva takes his troop of soldiers and travels far east to the land of Branga, where he wishes to find a clue to reach the Naga people. Shiva also learns that Sati's first child is still alive, as well as her twin sister. His journey ultimately leads him to the Naga capital of Panchavati, where he finds a surprise waiting for him.\n\nTripathi started writing The Secret of the Nagas while the first part of the trilogy was being released. He relied on his knowledge of geography and history to expand the locations visited in the story. The book was released on 12 August 2011, and was published by Westland Press. Before its release, the author confessed that many revelations would be present in the book, including the true nature of many characters. Two theatrical trailers were created for showing in multiplex cinema halls, as Tripathi believed that the film-going audience also reads his books, and that would create publicity.\n\nThe Secret of the Nagas was in high demand before its release, with 80,000 copies pre-ordered. The book quickly reached the top of best-seller listings, selling 95,000 copies the first month, before going for a re-print.

The book was released on 27 February 2013, through Westland Press and completes the mythical story about an imaginary land Meluha and how its inhabitants were saved by a barbarian named Shiva. Starting from where the previous installment left off, Shiva discovers what is the true evil in The Oath of the Vayuputras. Shiva then declares a holy war on those who seek to continue to use it, mainly the Emperors Daksha and Dilipa, who are being controlled by the sage Bhrigu. The battle rages on and Shiva travels to the land of Pariha to consult with Vayuputras, a legendary tribe. By the time he returns, the war has ended with Sati, his wife, being murdered. An enraged Shiva destroys the capital of Meluha and Somras is wiped out of history. The story concludes with Shiva and his associates being popularized as Gods for their deeds and accomplishments.\n\nTripathi had confirmed in September 2011 that he was writing The Oath of the Vayuputras, with Westland announcing the release date as 27 February 2013. The book was longer than the previous installments of the series and Tripathi clarified that all the loose ends left out in the previous book would be addressed, with the death of certain characters. Following the release of the cover art, it was announced that the publication rights of the books have been bought by both US and UK publisher houses. Like The Immortals of Meluha and The Secret of the Nagas, the book contained innovative marketing techniques, including launching interactive apps, merchandise and a music album titled Vayuputras, containing music inspired by different events in the series.\n\nAfter its release, The Oath of the Vayuputras received positive reviews for the story and characterisation with Business Standard calling Tripathi 'India's Tolkien'. However, his continued insistence on using modern, easy English gave way to a negative review by Mint. The book was a commercial success with 350,000 copies for pre-order, and an initial print-run of 500,000 copies. On the first day of the release itself, the book sold the initial print-run breaking the record for the fastest selling book in India. This prompted Westland to pay Tripathi an advance amount of ₹5 crore (US$660,000) for Tripathi's next book series.

The story is set in the land of Meluha and starts with the arrival of the Shiva. The Meluhans believe that Shiva is their fabled saviour Neelkanth. Shiva decides to help the Meluhans in their war against the Chandravanshis, who had joined forces with a cursed Nagas; however, during his journey and the fight that ensues, Shiva learns how his choices actually reflect who he aspires to be and how they lead to dire consequences.\n\nTripathi had initially decided to write a book on the philosophy of evil, but was dissuaded by his family members, so he decided to write a book on Shiva, one of the Hindu Gods. He decided to base his story on a radical idea that all Gods were once human beings; it was their deeds in the human life that made them famous as Gods. After finishing writing The Immortals of Meluha, Tripathi faced rejection from many publication houses. Ultimately when his agent decided to publish the book himself, Tripathi embarked on a promotional campaign. It included posting a live-action video on YouTube, and making the first chapter of the book available as a free digital download, to entice readers.\n\nUltimately, when the book was published in February 2010, it went on to become a huge commercial success. It had to be reprinted a number of times to keep up with the demand. Tripathi even changed his publisher and hosted a big launch for the book in Delhi. It was critically appreciated by some Indian reviewers, others noted that Tripathi's writing tended to lose focus at some parts of the story.

The story is set in the land of Meluha and starts with the arrival of the Shiva. The Meluhans believe that Shiva is their fabled saviour Neelkanth. Shiva decides to help the Meluhans in their war against the Chandravanshis, who had joined forces with a cursed Nagas; however, during his journey and the fight that ensues, Shiva learns how his choices actually reflect who he aspires to be and how they lead to dire consequences.\n\nTripathi had initially decided to write a book on the philosophy of evil, but was dissuaded by his family members, so he decided to write a book on Shiva, one of the Hindu Gods. He decided to base his story on a radical idea that all Gods were once human beings; it was their deeds in the human life that made them famous as Gods. After finishing writing The Immortals of Meluha, Tripathi faced rejection from many publication houses. Ultimately when his agent decided to publish the book himself, Tripathi embarked on a promotional campaign. It included posting a live-action video on YouTube, and making the first chapter of the book available as a free digital download, to entice readers.\n\nUltimately, when the book was published in February 2010, it went on to become a huge commercial success. It had to be reprinted a number of times to keep up with the demand. Tripathi even changed his publisher and hosted a big launch for the book in Delhi. It was critically appreciated by some Indian reviewers, others noted that Tripathi's writing tended to lose focus at some parts of the story. With the launch of the third installment, titled The Oath of the Vayuputras, in February 2013, the Shiva Trilogy has become the fastest selling book series in the history of Indian publishing, with 2.5 million copies in print and over ₹60 crore (US$7.9 million) in sales.", "user_id"=>"3"}, "commit"=>"Update Post", "id"=>"13"}

Despite this, the agent manages to reach the bomb again, but it explodes and burns his face. Someone approaches and helps him to grasp his time-travelling device, which transports him to a hospital in 1992. While the agent is recovering from facial reconstruction and symptoms of psychosis, it is revealed that he has been trying to prevent the attack of the so-called \"Fizzle Bomber\" in New York in 1975. After his recovery, he receives his last assignment.\n\nThe agent moves to 1970 New York. As a bartender, he starts a conversation with one of his customers. The customer writes true confession articles under the pen name \"The Unmarried Mother.\" This pseudonym is explained by his own life story, which he tells the agent.\n\nBorn female, the customer grew up as \"Jane\" in a Cleveland orphanage. She excelled in her studies but had difficulty fitting in. Jane decided any children she had would be raised in a proper family and thus avoided relationships. As an adult she applied for a program called \"Space Corp\", which promised women the chance to go to space while providing astronauts with intimate R&R, but she was later disqualified because of a medical condition which had never before been revealed to her but which greatly interested a man named Robertson.\n\nIn 1963, Jane bumped into a man who said he was waiting for someone. The two eventually fell in love, but one day the man disappeared. In time, Robertson approached Jane, revealing that Space Corp was really a part of the Temporal Agency, which now wanted to recruit her. They broke off contact when it was discovered that Jane was pregnant with her ex-lover's baby. While performing a Caesarean section, doctors discovered Jane was intersex, possessing internal male and female sex organs. Complications during the birth forced them to remove her female sex organs; she then underwent a gender reassignment and began living as a man. Furthermore, her baby was stolen by a mysterious man. Ever since then Jane, who now goes by John, has been living a bitter life, writing fiction as \"The Unmarried Mother.\"\n\nThe agent offers to take John back in time to the day that Jane met the man who would later become her lover and leave her, so that John can take revenge and kill the man for ruining his (Jane's) life. In return, John will take over the agent's job for whatever duration he wishes. The agent reveals his time-travel device and the two jump to that day in 1963 Cleveland. John intends to kill his past lover prior to the moment when the lover first meets Jane. While waiting, John encounters Jane, and as they begin talking, John realizes that he is the man who later becomes Jane's lover. The baby born from this \"self-fertilization\" is stolen by the agent, who uses his time machine to take the baby to 1945, leaving the child at the orphanage where Jane was raised. Therefore, Jane, John, and their baby are the same person, a predestination paradox.\n\nThe agent goes to 1975 New York, where he helps his burned self from the beginning of the film. The agent returns to 1963, a few months after he dropped John off. He convinces John to leave Jane behind, and he uses his time machine to take them both to the Temporal Agency in 1985. John takes over the agent's job so the agent can retire in 1975 New York, close to the day of the Fizzle Bomber's attack. Upon entering this time period, the agent discovers that the time-travel device does not decommission itself as planned and can still be used. Following orders, he goes to a laundromat at the moment the Fizzle Bomber will be there. The Fizzle Bomber turns out to be the agent's own future self, now suffering from psychosis as a result of continued time travel. The Fizzle Bomber insists that his actions have saved and will save more lives than have been lost because he bombed places before potential mass murderers could use them, and that they ultimately lead to the reinforcement of the Temporal Agency. He tries to convince the agent that the only way to end the cycle is for the agent to spare his life. The agent denies he will ever become the Fizzle Bomber and kills his future self.\n\nAs the agent stares at the time-travel device, it is revealed that John is the man who traveled to 1975 New York and was burned while disarming a bomb. His subsequent facial reconstruction in 1992 significantly changes his appearance, and it is now clear that Jane, John, the agent, and the Fizzle Bomber are all the same person.

  Parameters: {"authenticity_token"=>"[FILTERED]", "post"=>{"title"=>"Predestination (film)", "author"=>"Arundhati Roy", "text"=>"As a time-travelling agent is trying to disarm a bomb, he is confronted by a person who tries to stop him and a gunfight ensues. Despite this, the agent manages to reach the bomb again, but it explodes and burns his face. Someone approaches and helps him to grasp his time-travelling device, which transports him to a hospital in 1992. While the agent is recovering from facial reconstruction and symptoms of psychosis, it is revealed that he has been trying to prevent the attack of the so-called \"Fizzle Bomber\" in New York in 1975. After his recovery, he receives his last assignment.\n\nThe agent moves to 1970 New York. As a bartender, he starts a conversation with one of his customers. The customer writes true confession articles under the pen name \"The Unmarried Mother.\" This pseudonym is explained by his own life story, which he tells the agent.\n\nBorn female, the customer grew up as \"Jane\" in a Cleveland orphanage. She excelled in her studies but had difficulty fitting in. Jane decided any children she had would be raised in a proper family and thus avoided relationships. As an adult she applied for a program called \"Space Corp\", which promised women the chance to go to space while providing astronauts with intimate R&R, but she was later disqualified because of a medical condition which had never before been revealed to her but which greatly interested a man named Robertson.\n\nIn 1963, Jane bumped into a man who said he was waiting for someone. The two eventually fell in love, but one day the man disappeared. In time, Robertson approached Jane, revealing that Space Corp was really a part of the Temporal Agency, which now wanted to recruit her. They broke off contact when it was discovered that Jane was pregnant with her ex-lover's baby. While performing a Caesarean section, doctors discovered Jane was intersex, possessing internal male and female sex organs. Complications during the birth forced them to remove her female sex organs; she then underwent a gender reassignment and began living as a man. Furthermore, her baby was stolen by a mysterious man. Ever since then Jane, who now goes by John, has been living a bitter life, writing fiction as \"The Unmarried Mother.\"\n\nThe agent offers to take John back in time to the day that Jane met the man who would later become her lover and leave her, so that John can take revenge and kill the man for ruining his (Jane's) life. In return, John will take over the agent's job for whatever duration he wishes. The agent reveals his time-travel device and the two jump to that day in 1963 Cleveland. John intends to kill his past lover prior to the moment when the lover first meets Jane. While waiting, John encounters Jane, and as they begin talking, John realizes that he is the man who later becomes Jane's lover. The baby born from this \"self-fertilization\" is stolen by the agent, who uses his time machine to take the baby to 1945, leaving the child at the orphanage where Jane was raised. Therefore, Jane, John, and their baby are the same person, a predestination paradox.\n\nThe agent goes to 1975 New York, where he helps his burned self from the beginning of the film. The agent returns to 1963, a few months after he dropped John off. He convinces John to leave Jane behind, and he uses his time machine to take them both to the Temporal Agency in 1985. John takes over the agent's job so the agent can retire in 1975 New York, close to the day of the Fizzle Bomber's attack. Upon entering this time period, the agent discovers that the time-travel device does not decommission itself as planned and can still be used. Following orders, he goes to a laundromat at the moment the Fizzle Bomber will be there. The Fizzle Bomber turns out to be the agent's own future self, now suffering from psychosis as a result of continued time travel. The Fizzle Bomber insists that his actions have saved and will save more lives than have been lost because he bombed places before potential mass murderers could use them, and that they ultimately lead to the reinforcement of the Temporal Agency. He tries to convince the agent that the only way to end the cycle is for the agent to spare his life. The agent denies he will ever become the Fizzle Bomber and kills his future self.\n\nAs the agent stares at the time-travel device, it is revealed that John is the man who traveled to 1975 New York and was burned while disarming a bomb. His subsequent facial reconstruction in 1992 significantly changes his appearance, and it is now clear that Jane, John, the agent, and the Fizzle Bomber are all the same person. This agent's creation was ultimately orchestrated by Robertson to create an agent who has no ties to time. This temporal agent was responsible for both his own conception and death; he has driven the predestination paradox to its limit.

Despite this, the agent manages to reach the bomb again, but it explodes and burns his face. Someone approaches and helps him to grasp his time-travelling device, which transports him to a hospital in 1992. While the agent is recovering from facial reconstruction and symptoms of psychosis, it is revealed that he has been trying to prevent the attack of the so-called \"Fizzle Bomber\" in New York in 1975. After his recovery, he receives his last assignment.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe agent moves to 1970 New York. As a bartender, he starts a conversation with one of his customers. The customer writes true confession articles under the pen name \"The Unmarried Mother.\" This pseudonym is explained by his own life story, which he tells the agent.\n\nBorn female, the customer grew up as \"Jane\" in a Cleveland orphanage. She excelled in her studies but had difficulty fitting in. Jane decided any children she had would be raised in a proper family and thus avoided relationships. As an adult she applied for a program called \"Space Corp\", which promised women the chance to go to space while providing astronauts with intimate R&R, but she was later disqualified because of a medical condition which had never before been revealed to her but which greatly interested a man named Robertson.\n\nIn 1963, Jane bumped into a man who said he was waiting for someone. The two eventually fell in love, but one day the man disappeared. In time, Robertson approached Jane, revealing that Space Corp was really a part of the Temporal Agency, which now wanted to recruit her. They broke off contact when it was discovered that Jane was pregnant with her ex-lover's baby. While performing a Caesarean section, doctors discovered Jane was intersex, possessing internal male and female sex organs. Complications during the birth forced them to remove her female sex organs; she then underwent a gender reassignment and began living as a man. Furthermore, her baby was stolen by a mysterious man. Ever since then Jane, who now goes by John, has been living a bitter life, writing fiction as \"The Unmarried Mother.\"\n\nThe agent offers to take John back in time to the day that Jane met the man who would later become her lover and leave her, so that John can take revenge and kill the man for ruining his (Jane's) life. In return, John will take over the agent's job for whatever duration he wishes. The agent reveals his time-travel device and the two jump to that day in 1963 Cleveland. John intends to kill his past lover prior to the moment when the lover first meets Jane. While waiting, John encounters Jane, and as they begin talking, John realizes that he is the man who later becomes Jane's lover. The baby born from this \"self-fertilization\" is stolen by the agent, who uses his time machine to take the baby to 1945, leaving the child at the orphanage where Jane was raised. Therefore, Jane, John, and their baby are the same person, a predestination paradox.\n\nThe agent goes to 1975 New York, where he helps his burned self from the beginning of the film. The agent returns to 1963, a few months after he dropped John off. He convinces John to leave Jane behind, and he uses his time machine to take them both to the Temporal Agency in 1985. John takes over the agent's job so the agent can retire in 1975 New York, close to the day of the Fizzle Bomber's attack. Upon entering this time period, the agent discovers that the time-travel device does not decommission itself as planned and can still be used. Following orders, he goes to a laundromat at the moment the Fizzle Bomber will be there. The Fizzle Bomber turns out to be the agent's own future self, now suffering from psychosis as a result of continued time travel. The Fizzle Bomber insists that his actions have saved and will save more lives than have been lost because he bombed places before potential mass murderers could use them, and that they ultimately lead to the reinforcement of the Temporal Agency. He tries to convince the agent that the only way to end the cycle is for the agent to spare his life. The agent denies he will ever become the Fizzle Bomber and kills his future self.\n\nAs the agent stares at the time-travel device, it is revealed that John is the man who traveled to 1975 New York and was burned while disarming a bomb. His subsequent facial reconstruction in 1992 significantly changes his appearance, and it is now clear that Jane, John, the agent, and the Fizzle Bomber are all the same person.
